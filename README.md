# Client side

## React Client Application Routes

- Route `/`: home page (front-office), shows the list of published page, doesn't require authentication
- Route `/pages/:pageId`: view a published page; all the information and content are shown to anyone, it doesn't require authentication
- Route `/back-office`: main page of the back-office, shows the list of all created pages to the authenticated user
- Route `/back-office/pages/:pageId`: view (or preview) any page, even if it is not published; it requires authentication
- Route `/back-office/edit/:pageId`: edit properties and content of a page, requires authentication and the user should be either admin or the author of the page
- Route `/back-office/add`: create a new page, requires authentication
- Route `/login`: route to perform authentication
- Route `/admin/dashboard`: dashboard for the admin, from where he can change the name of the website

## Main React Components

- `FrontOffice` (in `FrontOffice.js`): shows the list of published pages
- `BackOffice` (in `BackOffice.js`): shows the list of every created page, requires authentication; from here the user can: preview, edit, add and remove a page if they have authorizations
- `ViewPage` (in `ViewPage.js`): shows the full content of a page and its information
- `AddPage` (in `AddPage.js`): form to add a new page, contains EditBlocks component
- `EditPage` (in `EditPage.js`): form to edit an existing page, contains EditBlocks component
- `EditBlocks` (in `EditBlocks.js`): form to edit the list of content blocks in a page; blocks can be re-ordered, added or remove, and their content can be edited
- `LoginForm` (in `LoginForm.js`): form to perform login
